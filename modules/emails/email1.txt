Dear Dr. John Smith,
I am sending you this email to express my gratitude about the work your company is doing
and how great your team's efforts are, i am very happy because i had the opportunity to meet
such awesome people.
I used to live in a really bad neighbourhood at the old address Baker Street 221B London, but your people helped
me find a much suitable location for me.
My phone number is +36303030300 in case you are trying to reach me.
Best regards,
